\begin{abstract}
	Credit card default happens when you've become severely delinquent on your credit card payment.

  It's a serious credit card status that not only affects your standing with that credit card issuer, but also your credit standing in general and your ability to get approved for credit cards, loans, and other credit-based services.
	
	When you accept a credit card, you agree to certain terms, e.g. you agree to make your minimum payment by the due date listed on your credit card statement.
	
	 If you miss the minimum credit card payment six months in a row, your credit card will be in default; your credit card issuer will likely close your account and report the default to the credit bureaus.
	
	By the time your credit card defaults, you've likely accumulated hundreds of dollars in fees and interest charges. 
	
	
    Unfortunately, your options for clearing up the credit card default may be limited because of the number of payments you've missed on your account. 
    
    For this reason, assuming truthful the given data, we show the procedure used to create prevision algorithm aiming to foresee the default payment's client.
